# PassByValue
Pass By Value is when the called method uses a copy of the parameter variable of the caller method. If the called method modifies its parameter variable then the effect would not be visible to the caller method's variable.

# PassByReference

Pass By Reference is when the caller method and the called method uses the same variable as their parameter(basically pointer to the memory address). If the called method makes any changes to the parameter variable then the effect would be visible to the caller method's variable as well.

# Java Is Strictly Pass by Value

Whether the parameter variable is primitive or an object reference, in both cases, you are basically creating a copy of the parameter variable and not manipulating the original parameter variable.
