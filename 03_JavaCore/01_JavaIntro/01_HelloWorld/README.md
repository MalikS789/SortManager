# Notes

### OOP
- Java is an Object Oriented Language
- Classes and objects break down the parts of a program
- Objects have **state** and **behaviour**. Primitive values just have **state**
- Objects are created with a constructor. Classes have a default constructor which takes no parameters
- Using getters and setters (with intellij)
- Using abstract classes
- Strongly typed
- Statically typed

### OOP principles
- Inheritance: A class using the behaviour of another class
    - Parent child relationship
    - *Selfish children and selfless parents*
    - "is a" type relationship
    - `extends` keyword 
    - Single inheritance
- Encapsulation
    - Information hiding
    - Using access modifiers to limit access to member variables
    - Using getters and setters
- Abstraction
    - Exposing features of a class while hiding implementation
    - Achieved with Interfaces, Abstract classes and access modifiers
- Polymorphism
    - *Many forms*
    - Creating different objects and methods from an Interface or Class
    - Overriding and Overloading
