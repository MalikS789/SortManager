# Notes

### Arrays
- Collections of values
- Only uses primitive types
- Fixed length


### Loops
- Used for repetition
- If, while and do while loops
- Makes use of binary operators
- Used to control the flow of a program
- Be careful of infinite loops!
- Arrays and loops go well together

### Switch statements 
- Like an extended if statement
- Only works with primitive types and Enum types
- Enhanced in Java 13
