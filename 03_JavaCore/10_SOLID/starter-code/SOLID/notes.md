# Design Principles

### Code Reuse
- Code once written, should not require modification
- Easy to transfer

### Scalability
- Dealing with increased workload

### Extensibility
- Adding new functionality or modifying existing functionality
- New functionality should be able to be 'plugged-in' to the code base.

### Maintainability
- Code should be easy to modify or extend
- It should be easy to find and fix errors
- Code should be eas to read and understand

## SOLID
#### Single Responsibility principle
- **A class should do one thing and do it well**
#### Open-Closed design principle
- **A class should be open for extension but closed for modification**
#### Liskov substitution principle
- **Derived classes must be substitutable for their base classes**
#### Interface segregation principle
- **Make fine grained interfaces that are client specific**
