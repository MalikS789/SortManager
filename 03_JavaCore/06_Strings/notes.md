# Strings

- Class in Java but treated like a primitive type
- Basically a sequence of characters
- Created in two ways

Firstly by using the new keyword:

String message = new String("Hello World");

Secondly, a string can by specifying a literal:

String message = "Hello World"

## String pool
- This special area of memory is responsible for storing strings created using a string literal.
