# Recursions

## What of Recursions?

- Recursion is a programming technique in which a method can call itself to solve a problem.
- There are two main requirements when creating a recursive call:
     - A base or stop condition - at some point this condition will be met and no further recursive calls will be made.
     - A recursive call - calls will continue to be made to itself until the base condition is met.

## Head Recursion
Head recursive call is made before it performs its own task and this process is known as head recursion.

## Tail Recursion
With tail recursion, the last line of the method is the recursive call. This means that the method has nothing left to execute so, in theory, does not need to add to the stack.
