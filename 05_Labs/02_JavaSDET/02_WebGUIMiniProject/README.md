## Web GUI Mini Project
You have been asked to create a testing framework for a Sparta Global Registration Form

You will need to submit the following:

- A fully functional framework for testing the form
- An example test bed showing all the possible tests that can be performed
- A well written README file explaining how a tester will use your framework
- Details of what you wanted to test, what you tested and what you couldn't test

Make sure that you are able to test:
- The core functionality of the Form
- Any error messages/indicators that appear
- That the form can be filled in successfully 

You will also be presenting your framework to the rest of the group. Plan this as if we are a group of testers interested in purchasing your framework. This presentation will be 10-15 minutes in length

Presentation sections:
- The Form you are testing
- Demo of the framework running
- What did you test? How did you decide what to test?
- How is the frame work structured?
- Your README file

Your Github repositry will also be checked for commit history and branches used. Please do not delete any branches from your project. When merging your code from dev to master, please include me in the request (@MGadhvi)
